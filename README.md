## Hooks library

This repo is just to write out some common React hooks that I like to use. I generally just copy and paste them into a project if I need them, and you can feel free to do the same. If I did not write the hook but instead got it from somewhere else, that credit will be given at the top of the file. If you see a hook here that you wrote, and you would like it removed, please let me know.

### More info

This app is a create-react-app blank application for when I want to integrate the hook into an app and see how it works out. I'll probably not commit any changes to the default stuff, as the hooks folder is the only thing that matters.
